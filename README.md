Console audio visualizer with Youtube API

You can see it in action in my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg5kk1sIKPg)

## What does it do?
You can input video title and it will download it from Youtube and then play it with cool visuals

## Prerequisites
* [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading youtube videos
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for parsing between audio formats

## Todo
This app is still missing some features like:
* streaming and visualizing in real-time
* support for resizing console window during runtime
